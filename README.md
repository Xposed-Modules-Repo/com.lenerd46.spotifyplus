# Spotify Plus
Spotify Plus is an Xposed module that adds beautiful lyrics to Spotify<br/><br/>
This project is still very early in development, many features are still not implemented yet

## What Is Spotify Plus
For right now, Spotify Plus is an Xposed module that adds beautiful lyrics inside of Spotify. The beautiful lyrics are heavily based on the [beautiful lyrics](https://github.com/surfbryce/beautiful-lyrics) extension by [Surfbryce](https://github.com/surfbryce). A lot of this I learned from my other project of porting that extension to a [standalone mobile app](https://github.com/LeNerd46/beautiful-lyrics-mobile).

## Getting Started
Requirements:
* A rooted phone with LSPosed installed
* LSPatch for non rooted phones
<br/><br/>


For Rooted Phones:
1. Install the APK from the releases page
2. Turn on the module in LSPosed and enable it for Spotify
3. Force stop Spotify
4. Play a song, open the full screen lyrics page, and enjoy the lyrics!
<br/><br/>

For Non Rooted Phones:
1. Install the APK from the releases page
2. Download a Spotify APK (you can get it [here](https://spotify.en.uptodown.com/android/download))
3. Setup LSPatch (if using Android 15 or Android 16, using [this fork](https://github.com/JingMatrix/LSPatch))
4. Press the plus button -> Select apk from storage -> and find your Spotify APK file
5. Select Local, then start the patch
6. Inside of LSPatch, tap on Spotify, select module scope, and select Spotify Plus
7. Force stop Spotify
8. Enjoy the new features!

> [!NOTE]
> The latest recommended version of Spotify to use is v9.0.90.1229. The module is not guaranteed to work past this version

## Main Features
* Beautiful Lyrics!
* There's a couple other smaller things that I don't really feel like writing down

For now, that is all that this module does. I have lots of plans for this mod though. The ultimate dream would be to have something like spicetify, but for mobile. For now though, beautiful lyrics was the most important feature for me
